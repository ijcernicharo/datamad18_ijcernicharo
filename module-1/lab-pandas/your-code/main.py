14. What you want to do is to count the number of occurrences of each unique genre values.
 Because you already know how to obtain the unique genre values, you can of course count the # of apps of each genre one by one.

 Google for "pandas count values" to find the solution. Your code should return the following:

15. First, filter `data` where the price is 0.00. Assign the filtered data to a new variable called `free_apps`.
