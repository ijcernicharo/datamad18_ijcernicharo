    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your `get_bow_from_doc` function, you will call each of those functions you created to clean up the HTML before you generate the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please use Python string operations and regular expression only in this lab. Do not use extra libraries such as `beautifulsoup` because otherwise you loose the purpose of practicing."

He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps  the job hunt instantly becomes much harder.  Take your LinkedIn  networking  and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort  and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.\n",
      "264  :   \n",
      "265  :   I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300  jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding  I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp  but do not quit.\n",

You get everything you need from them and now it s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100  do it again  I put my life on hold  invested in myself  pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack  but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.\n",

      "283  :   This Review Is Helpful4Flag as inappropriate.IronhackAwesome learning experience 9 23 2018Alexander Teodor Mazilu     Campus  Miami Verified via LinkedInAwesome learning experience Overall Experience Curriculum Instructors Job Assistance I recently completed the part time Web Development course  and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their skills or technological knowledge base. I had an all around wonderful learning experience. You don t need to have much computer knowledge going into it  because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA s  Manuel  Colby  and Adrian  who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble  had bugs  or just got lost. They were always nice  patient  and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning  including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with  and grateful for  each of them.\n",
      "284  :   \n",
      "285  :   I was also very impressed with the professor  Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient  courteous  and welcoming of questions  feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan  is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges  to prepare us to think like computer scientists  and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview  and explain the different ways to approach the problems  and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course  and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution.  Protip  Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents  I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker  get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT   Get a whiteboard  for your house  and write important concepts  objectives  goals  and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews  and they re abstract  and frustrating if you are not prepared.\n",
      "286  :   \n",
      "287  :   After graduation  you ll be counseled by Brito  your career counselor  who is also a very cool  down to earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process  how to construct your resume  and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive  helpful  and make sure you land a good starting job  well after graduation.\n",
      "288  :   \n",
      "289  :   Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers  to the teacher s assistants  to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with.\n",
      "290  :   \n",
      "291  :   Also  I was blown away by the Ux UI students. We  the web dev class  got a chance to work with them in the hackathon  which was a totally awesome experience  and they were very impressive. I legitimately wish I could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology  creativity  and organized thought processes. They were amazing. I loved working with them.\n",

      "303  :   What s your career and education background  How did your path lead to a bootcamp\n",
      "304  :   \n",
      "305  :   My career path has been very diverse so far. I m originally from Austria and I did a bachelor s degree in multimedia in London and Honolulu  with the aim of working in graphic design and video production  but I found the job opportunities were not the kind of jobs I imagined them to be. Then I did an MBA in Vienna and San Diego to increase my career options and ended up in finance in Barcelona.\n",
      "306  :   \n",
      "307  :   After three years  I got bored with finance and wanted to figure out what to do with my life. I had always been interested in technology and worked for a while on a family business focused on the Internet of Things. I enjoyed researching technologies  philosophical aspects of the business  and looking at the direction in which the world is heading.\n",
      "308  :   \n",
      "309  :   I eventually came across Free Code Camp and enjoyed it a lot. My friends who work in web development told me if I became a web developer  I would be learning for the rest of my life. At first that sounded intimidating  but it made me realize that s exactly what I want to do with my life   it s a way to make sure I won t get bored  I can keep learning  and getting better at what I do. It goes hand in hand with my personality because I love to learn and do new things. I think that s why web development is the right choice for me.\n",
      "310  :   \n",
      "311  :   You ve traveled a lot   what made you choose Ironhack in Barcelona  rather than another bootcamp in a different city  going back to college  or teaching yourself\n",
      "312  :   \n",
      "313  :   I considered teaching myself  but going to university wasn t an option   it was between teaching myself and going to the bootcamp. As a beginner  the best way to change careers was to go full on  and be around professionals   the teachers at Ironhack are very talented  and are professionals who have been in the field for a long time.\n",
      "314  :   \n",
      "315  :   I moved to Barcelona three years ago  and fell in love with the city  so it was clear to me that I wanted to do a bootcamp here. I talked to people about the best technologies and languages to learn  and everyone confirmed that Ironhack had the best full stack JavaScript curriculum. Barcelona has a good tech atmosphere and a growing startup scene. I d eventually like to have the flexibility to work remotely  and I think that Barcelona will allow that.\n",
      "316  :   \n",
      "317  :   Also  the course I did was taught in English. In Barcelona  Ironhack offers one full time cohort in English  and one full time cohort and one part time cohort in Spanish.\n",
      "318  :   \n",
      "319  :   What was the Ironhack application and interview process like for you\n",
      "320  :   \n",
      "321  :   The first part was a personality interview to see if you re really genuinely interested in doing the course and pursuing a career in web development. After passing that first interview  I was given some very basic coding exercises. After those exercises  I had a technical interview with a teacher assistant  which I passed before getting accepted into Ironhack.\n",
      "322  :   \n",
      "323  :   What was the learning experience like at Ironhack  What was the teaching style\n",
      "324  :   \n",
      "325  :   I have to be honest  it was very very tough for me. This was the first time I had done a course in web development. Ironhack was split into three modules. First we had the basic front end module  which was pretty doable. The second module was back end  which for me was very difficult  then the final module was back end with the Angular framework  which was also demanding.\n",
      "326  :   \n",
      "327  :   The hours were very intense. Officially  the hours are 9am to 6pm  like a full time job  but I don t remember many days when we actually finished at 6. If you re at Ironhack  then it s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can.\n",
      "328  :   \n",
      "329  :   The teaching was also quite intense. I m 30 now so I had been out of school for many years  and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than I thought it would be. But as intense as it was  it was also very satisfying. Your character really shows when you re learning web development   you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges  but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding.\n",
      "330  :   \n",
      "331  :   What was your cohort like\n",
      "332  :   \n",
      "333  :   Ironhack was one of the most diverse experiences I ve ever had. Some of my classmates were 18 and had come straight out of high school  and the oldest guy was in his late 40s. The average person was somebody who had decided to change their career.\n",
      "334  :   \n",
      "335  :   We were very international. There were around 22 students in my class   four of those students were Spanish  and the rest of them were from all over the world  including Europeans and Latin Americans.\n",
      "336  :   \n",
      "337  :   What was your favorite project that you built at Ironhack\n",
      "338  :   \n",
      "339  :   My favorite project was my first project   I created a game of blackjack with front end JavaScript. Since it was my first project  I felt like I had accomplished something that I never in my life thought I could have accomplished. Of course we got help from the teachers  but it s quite impressive to see what you  yourself are capable of doing. Before we started the project  I was clueless. I honestly had no idea what I was going to do  how I was going to do it  and I didn t believe I could do it. But after completing the project  it was really impressive to see what I could get myself to do.\n",
      "340  :   \n",
      "341  :   How did Ironhack prepare you for job hunting\n",
      "342  :   \n",
      "343  :   When I was researching bootcamps  it was really important for me to be able to land a job as soon as possible  and Ironhack pretty much guarantees that almost all alumni who want to find work will find work in the field. Right after bootcamp  we had a hiring day where more than 20 recruiters from tech companies came to the campus to see our work. It was a quick interview where we show them our project  they ask questions  they get to know us  and we get to know the companies.\n",
      "344  :   \n",
      "345  :   Sonia  my Careers Adviser  was always getting in touch with companies  and getting my input about what I d like to do. On top of that  I thought it was amazing that after I landed a job and needed some guidance  one of the TAs still gave me advice and input. Even now  I feel like I can go back to Ironhack and get support any time I need it. I try not to milk it  but they are just so helpful and so caring.\n",

      "348  :   \n",
      "349  :   Everis did come to Ironhack for the hiring day  but I didn t get a chance to talk to them because there were so many companies there. So the next day  I contacted them and told them I had missed them  but I wanted to get to know them   I was quite active about reaching out to companies. They replied immediately  I went into the office that same day for an interview. Within two weeks  they called me in for a second interview  and shortly after that I received an offer. I was exhausted after graduating from Ironhack  so I took a month off over the holidays  but about a month into my job search  I was working at Everis.\n",
      "350  :   \n",
      "351  :   Can you tell me about Everis and what you work on there\n",
      "352  :   \n",
      "353  :   Everis is a consultancy  so we work on projects with different clients. I m a Junior Front End Developer  and I work with Angular and Typescript. It s a purely front end job  which is what I wanted.\n",
      "354  :   \n",
      "355  :   I m on my second project since I started at Everis. The first project was a web app to help organizations apply for governmental loans. It was a very small  global team   two people in Barcelona  two people in Zaragoza  Spain  and the project manager was based in Brussels  Belgium. For my current project there are four of us and we re all based in Barcelona  except for the project manager who is based in Zaragoza.\n",
      "356  :   \n",
      "357  :   It s a huge company  I think there are about 3000 people in Barcelona  and they have branches around the world. The company is very diverse  and the teams are very diverse as well. They have an emphasis on hiring very gender balanced teams  which is nice  Everis is definitely more gender balanced than other companies.\n",
      "358  :   \n",
      "359  :   Are you using the technologies and programming languages at Everis that you learned at Ironhack\n",
      "360  :   \n",
      "361  :   I m working in Angular  which is a framework we covered in the third module of Ironhack. There are always new things to learn in Angular  because Angular is quite complex and always evolving. So I haven t learned any new languages or frameworks  but I had to learn more about Angular on the job.\n",
      "362  :   \n",
      "363  :   Ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily. In the future  I will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks. But now I have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp.\n",
      "364  :   \n",
      "365  :   Since you joined Everis  how do you feel you ve grown as a front end developer\n",
      "366  :   \n",
      "367  :   In 6 months  I feel like I ve become a lot more independent  and I m less afraid of touching the code. In addition  I ve developed a passion for problems  As weird as that sounds  I enjoy running into problems because I enjoy solving them. It s very fulfilling. Honestly  I think Ironhack is the best decision I ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development. I haven t regretted it once.\n",

      "369  :   How has your background in graphic design  finance  and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a Front End Developer\n",
      "370  :   \n",
      "371  :   Graphic design is very much about trends  and it s been a long time since I studied it. While there are some aspects of design that still apply  a lot has changed. At Everis  when we get a new project  a lot of the design is given by the client   my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself.\n",
      "372  :   \n",
      "373  :   My experience working in finance has definitely been useful at Everis. Having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment.\n",

      "375  :   What s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a Front End Developer\n",
      "376  :   \n",
      "377  :   Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time  and you start having to deal with your own frustrations. The more you get frustrated  the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically. That s a challenge that I ve had to learn to deal with  and I m really learning how to be calm and patient. I wasn t a patient person before  and I m now really seeing the results of patience.\n",
      "378  :   \n",

      "381  :   I was just at Ironhack last week actually and I m going again soon. A lot of people from my cohort have left  but I ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine  and we ve become quite tight. It s a very strong community. Whenever Ironhack hosts events  I prioritize them   it s a very good atmosphere and a great network  and every time I go there I feel like I m at home.\n",

      "383  :   What advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp\n",
      "384  :   \n",
      "385  :   Just do it. My best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you re going to reach your mental limits. You re going to have a hard time  but it s really worth it and it s very rewarding. There are going to be times when you ll want to feel very stupid   don t  If you can be a master of your emotions  then you have a good path ahead.\n",

The tech ecosystem is booming  and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place. People are flocking to Berlin because they like living here and there s plenty of job opportunities.\n",
      "427  :   \n",
      "428  :   Also  the IT jobs market in Germany has a growing digital skills gap. There are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers  along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process. McKinsey released a study saying there would be 100 000 digital jobs in Berlin by 2020  so that was big data point for us.\n",
      "429  :   \n",
      "430  :   Since students can go to university for free in Berlin  why would they want to pay to go to Ironhack\n",
      "431  :   \n",
      "432  :   Companies are demanding more people with digital skills  and four year universities just can t cater to that market. Ironhack believes universities  regardless of whether they are private or public  are failing to adapt to the digital revolution. The university approach hasn t changed in 100 years  and getting a job in this day and age requires a different  updated approach.\n",
      "433  :   \n",
      "434  :   Ironhack provides high impact  condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind   getting students from zero to job ready in three months. Because of this  we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value. Regardless  we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels.\n",
      "435  :   \n",
      "436  :   What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition in Berlin\n",
      "437  :   \n",
      "438  :   We are laser focused on one objective  enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "439  :   \n",
      "440  :   So how do we achieve that  Well  first we make our students employable. We constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand  and we hire professional instructors with real world experience to teach them. We provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program  and students are prepared for technical interviews  behavioral interviews  etc. We believe in learning by doing  so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they ve graduated.\n",
      "441  :   \n",
      "442  :   We also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities  by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort.\n",
      "443  :   \n",
      "444  :   What types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the Berlin campus\n",
      "445  :   \n",
      "446  :   We re looking for career changers. There are so many talented people in Berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities. Ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months. We cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn.\n",
      "447  :   \n",
      "448  :   How many students does Ironhack plan to accommodate at the Berlin campus\n",
      "449  :   \n",
      "450  :   We re going to have three cohorts in 2018. The first one starts in May  the second one in July and the third one in October. For the first cohort  we re looking at about 20 students. We don t like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality. Moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts  always ensuring students have the best possible experience.\n",
      "451  :   \n",
      "452  :   How do you source new instructors  What will be the instructor  student ratio\n",
      "453  :   \n",
      "454  :   We hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry. Our lead instructor for Berlin was working at the Ironhack Paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to Berlin. He s one of those people who has been coding his whole life. He started his own company  and he s worked in the industry as a lead developer   he has a very impressive background. And he already knows the Ironhack bootcamp and our course  so that s always a plus.\n",
      "455  :   \n",
      "456  :   At Ironhack  a lead instructor leads the whole program  and then we have teaching assistants  who are also coding professionals  for every eight students  to provide support and guide students through the course. For example  in the first cohort  if we have 20 students  we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants. Having gone through the bootcamp myself  I feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp.\n",
      "457  :   \n",
      "458  :   Will the curriculum at Ironhack Berlin be the same as other Ironhack campuses\n",
      "459  :   \n",
      "460  :   Ironhack s current curriculum is divided into three modules  Front end  HTML  CSS  amp  Javascript   Backend MEAN Stack  and Microservices with Angular 2  API s . We are always looking to make our curriculum better. We were teaching Ruby on Rails  but we decided to move on to . Also  something I always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn. I graduated from the Ruby on Rails course and was able to learn Node.js on my own just the next month.\n",
      "461  :   \n",
      "462  :   We re in contact with a lot of startups  so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand. We make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses. This allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality. So we re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now  but always looking to iterate and make it better.\n",
      "463  :   \n",
      "464  :   Tell us about the Berlin campus. What is the classroom like\n",
      "465  :   \n",
      "466  :   As with most of our new campuses  we ll be located at a WeWork co working space  a new building called Atrium Tower right on Potsdamer Platz. The space itself is a big room which holds around 40 students. When we visited the space about a month and a half ago  we fell in love with the facilities. The campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location  and it has an incredible terrace at the top.\n",
      "467  :   \n",
      "468  :   When you re going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program  being in a nice space with amenities   coffee  snacks  really nice views   is something really important.\n",
      "469  :   \n",
      "470  :   What are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your Berlin graduates landing after bootcamp\n",
      "471  :   \n",
      "472  :   We have a very strong reputation worldwide  with a global community of alumni and partners. For example  we just signed up N26  a mobile bank to be our hiring partner. We re in talks with several Berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too. At the end of each nine week course  we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students. Like I said  we re very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "473  :   \n",
      "474  :   In the past  we ve had companies like Google  Twitter  Visa  Rocket Internet  and Magic Leap hire Ironhack graduates. So in Berlin we re looking for the same profiles. Those are global companies we already have partnerships with  so our students already have access to that pool of employers. Then locally  we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entry level junior developers.\n",
      "475  :   \n",
      "476  :   Do you envision Berlin grads staying in Berlin  Is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied\n",
      "477  :   \n",
      "478  :   We have a big focus on having a global community. So we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities. For example  I recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the Madrid UX UI course to Berlin based N26. It s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in.\n",
      "479  :   \n",
      "480  :   A lot of people want to stay in their home city and others don t  so we cater to both. We try to give opportunities to go abroad  and options to work in the local market.\n",
      "481  :   \n",
      "482  :   What would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in Berlin\n",
      "483  :   \n",
      "484  :   I would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can. I always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there  and start talking to people. We actually just wrote a blog post about How to Land the Tech Job in Berlin  and one piece of advice is to mingle. Just network.\n",
      "485  :   \n",
      "486  :   Then  of course  I would recommend going to the Ironhack meetups. There are a bunch of workshops in Berlin and our informal network is huge. We re doing one free workshop every week and we ll do some bigger events as well.\n",
      "487  :   \n",
      "488  :   What advice do you have for someone who s thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Berlin and considering Ironhack\n",
      "489  :   \n",
      "490  :   Form my experience as an alum  I think it s all about the attitude. When you go into a coding bootcamp  there s always this feeling where you re a little bit scared because it is something really demanding. People have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical. But just start coding  It s not as difficult as it may seem  and having the right guidance is key. We re actually launching a cool challenge in Berlin   a free online course to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding.\n",
      "491  :   \n",
      "492  :   A lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it  and actually become really good programmers. You just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work. We have a 90  placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process  the majority of our students get hired. I recommend people to just go for it. I can guarantee that if you have the right attitude  you ll succeed.\n",

      "502  :   Global Tech School Ironhack is launching a new campus in Mexico City on January 15  2018. We spoke with Ironhack s VP of Operations  amp  Expansion  Alexandre Berriche  to learn about the Mexico City tech ecosystem and why there is a growing demand for developers in the area. This school uses feedback from their campuses around the world to continually improve the curriculum. Discover how Ironhack can connect you to a 1000  network of alumni  help you with job placement  and get some tips for your application\n",

      "505  :   \n",
      "506  :   What s your background  What drew you to want to work with Ironhack\n",
      "507  :   \n",
      "508  :   After starting my career in Private Equity  I joined Jumia a Rocket Internet company  also called the African Amazon. I was Head of Operations in North Africa and then Managing Director of Tunisia.I got in touch with Ariel and Gonzalo  the founders of Ironhack  and was really inspired by their vision. Also  since I actually attended a coding bootcamp myself  I was excited to come and work in this industry. I saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in Europe and also Latin America. I was keen to have an impact on people s lives  so I was super receptive to our conversation and working with Ironhack. It was a great fit.\n",
      "509  :   \n",
      "510  :   As the VP of Expansion  can you describe your role\n",
      "511  :   \n",
      "512  :   As VP of Expansion  I work with the founders to create a strategy and decide which markets make sense for us to open in next. Then I m involved with the operations preparation where I actually launch the new markets.\n",
      "513  :   \n",
      "514  :   There are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market. The first is human resources   we want to build an awesome team including a general manager. We were super excited to find a great GM for our Mexico campus. Marketing and brand awareness is number two. When you re launching in a new market  you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus. It can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch  so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations  events  and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem. The third area is legal   making sure the legal administration is completed. If you succeed in those three areas  you are ready to open in any market.\n",
      "515  :   \n",
      "516  :   What stood out about Mexico City  Why did Ironhack choose to open a campus there\n",
      "517  :   \n",
      "518  :   We are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally  and we ve been thinking about opening in Latin America for quite some time. Latin America is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills  but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area. In 2019 it is estimated there will be a deficit of 150 000 IT jobs in Mexico  so we can have a great impact on that. We want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry. Not many  if any  bootcamps have campuses in the U.S.  Europe  and in Latin America  so Latin America was very attractive to us.\n",
      "519  :   \n",
      "520  :   Mexico City was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem. It s one of the largest markets for startups. Mexico City is the entry for many tech companies moving to Latin America   Facebook  Amazon  and so on   so many tech multinationals are moving in.  The ecosystem is not just booming  it s also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of VC s  accelerators  and company builders.\n",
      "521  :   \n",
      "522  :   Finally  it s a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science. It s a big market to penetrate  but it s less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors. There are obviously some local competitors  whom we respect a lot  but we are going to give the Mexico City ecosystem access to Ironhack s global community which is already present in Miami  Paris  Barcelona  and Madrid. We think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in Mexico City.\n",
      "523  :   \n",
      "524  :   There are only a few bootcamps in Mexico City. How will Ironhack stand out once other bootcamps start to pop up\n",
      "525  :   \n",
      "526  :   Ironhack will stand out because we are global. We have already learned so much about running a bootcamp  because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges. So by bringing this experience into the market  we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for Mexico City. Ironhack has graduated 1 000 students  so we have a large community. We have alumni working for Amazon  Google  and IBM  which is a big plus. We have great reviews on Course Report  and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum. Over the four years we have been operating  we have continued to improve our teaching methods.\n",
      "527  :   \n",
      "528  :   What is the Ironhack Mexico City campus like\n",
      "529  :   \n",
      "530  :   Our offices are at the WeWork Insurgentes coworking space  and it s amazing to work alongside different Mexico City startups and see how dynamic the space is. It s super exciting. We re in the Colonia Napoles  which is like a district of startups. At WeWork we take up two rooms of 20 x 30 feet each which hold between 15 to 20 students. We will start with one class  and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time   one UX UI design course  and one web development course.\n",
      "531  :   \n",
      "532  :   Our objective at Ironhack is not quantitative  it s more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they don t have the required technical level. We are selective with students and we don t accept everyone.\n",
      "533  :   \n",
      "534  :   Could you describe the Ironhack application process  Is it the same across campuses\n",
      "535  :   \n",
      "536  :   Yes. We have two interviews   one personal interview and one technical interview. You can make it through the technical interview even if you don t have tons of knowledge  but you must be a hard worker. If you prepare your case  you can make it in  but we want to be selective.\n",
      "537  :   \n",
      "538  :   Before the bootcamp starts we also have pre work and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course. People are spending a lot of time and money to really improve  so the courses are very intensive for that reason.\n",
      "539  :   \n",
      "540  :   Ironhack teaches UX UI design and web development. Will you be teaching the same curriculum in Mexico City\n",
      "541  :   \n",
      "542  :   We collect feedback in each market  and with each piece of feedback we receive  we improve our curriculum little by little. We trust and use the same curriculum in every market. You can t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes. The feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program. I don t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities.\n",
      "543  :   \n",
      "544  :   How many instructors will you have at the Mexico City campus\n",
      "545  :   \n",
      "546  :   The number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase. For instance  at the Paris campus  four months after launching we had seven teachers. It will be the same for Mexico. So we ll start with one instructor and then after a few months  seven  and after one year maybe 10   we re going to see how fast it grows.\n",
      "547  :   \n",
      "548  :   Since Ironhack is a global bootcamp  how do you help with the job search and placement  What sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get\n",
      "549  :   \n",
      "550  :   We are trying to build partnerships with Linio  TIP  and many Mexican startups where we can place our students. Companies will be invited to Hiring Week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce. We ll start by targeting companies in Mexico City and then we ll expand and make partnerships with companies in Guadalajara and Monterrey as a second step.\n",
      "551  :   \n",
      "552  :   Most of our graduates become junior developers. We have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers. Ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that s why we are so focused on placement with Iron Week  and a placement manager in each market.\n",
      "553  :   \n",
      "554  :   Is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied\n",
      "555  :   \n",
      "556  :   We are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied  unless they re coming from abroad. We have a few international students and currently  most of them go to the Barcelona and Paris campuses. We don t know about Mexico City graduates yet  but most of our applications so far are from Mexico   with some international applicants as well.\n",
      "557  :   \n",
      "558  :   If someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Mexico City like Ironhack  do you have any meetup or event suggestions\n",
      "559  :   \n",
      "560  :   Yes  Ironhack is doing a huge full day event at WeWork on December 9th. Anyone can attend and it s free. This is a great opportunity to learn about tech  discover the Mexico City ecosystem and decide if you want to apply to Ironhack.\n",
      "561  :   \n",
      "562  :   What advice do you have for people thinking about attending a coding bootcamp like Ironhack\n",
      "563  :   \n",
      "564  :   The first thing is  it s an amazing commitment  and if you are applying for good reasons and have the technical ability  you will be accepted and get the best experience. It s a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career. You will learn so much  meet new companies  and get hired. If you want to learn more  go to the Ironhack website  download the application guide  and come to some events. We have a Meetup group and Facebook page. You can read plenty of reviews of the school on Course Report. If you are sure of your motivations  you are a hard worker  and you re committed  I m sure you will be accepted.\n",

      "603  :   Ironhack is a global web development bootcamp with locations in Madrid  Miami  Barcelona  and now Paris  We spoke with Ironhack s General Manager for France  Fran ois Fillette  to learn more about their new Paris campus  launching June 26th. France is the second largest tech ecosystem in Europe   learn why Ironhack chose to expand to the area  read how the bootcamp will stand out from the rest  and see what resources are available to become a successful bootcamp grad in Paris.\n",
      "604  :   \n",
      "605  :   First  as the France General Manager  tell me how you ve been involved with the new Ironhack campus.\n",
      "606  :   \n",
      "607  :   Sure  As a General Manager  I have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus   finding an amazing place for our students  recruiting a team of A players  setting up the docs and processes and so on. I have been working with Alex  our Head of International Expansion  who has been tremendously helpful. We have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our Paris campus will be on the same standards as the others.\n",
      "608  :   \n",
      "609  :   What s your background and how did you get involved with bootcamps  What drew you to want to work with Ironhack\n",
      "610  :   \n",
      "611  :   I was coming back from San Francisco  where I was working as VP of Strategy and Business Development for CodinGame. One of my VC friends told me that Ariel and Gonzalo  the cofounders  were looking for someone to launch Ironhack in France. I met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision  and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well. I got super excited by the project and the team  so a couple of days later I was in Miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for France  It s been 3 months now and honestly  I ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day\n",
      "612  :   \n",
      "613  :   Ironhack is launching their Paris campus on June 26th. Why is Paris a great place for a coding bootcamp  Could you explain Ironhack s motivation to expand there\n",
      "614  :   \n",
      "615  :   In terms of funding  France is now the 2nd largest tech ecosystem in Europe  right after England. Over the last 5 years  it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world. Take Station F for instance   thanks to Xavier Niel  cofounder of Free   Paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world. That growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players. There s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we ll do everything we can to reach our targets.\n",
      "616  :   \n",
      "617  :   There are a few other coding bootcamps in Paris. What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition\n",
      "618  :   \n",
      "619  :   Several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years  which shows you how dynamic the market is. I think 3 elements will set Ironhack apart from the competition. First  our courses are focused on the latest technologies   for example  full stack Javascript for Web Development   and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience. Then  we dedicate a large share of the course  60 70   to hands on  real life applications. Students work on real projects  submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startup business. Last  we help with the placement of our students if they re looking for a job  coaching for technical and behavioral interviews  connections to companies startups  events  etc. . We have an average placement rate of 90  after 3 months across our campuses.\n",
      "620  :   \n",
      "621  :   Let s discuss the Paris campus. What is the classroom like  What neighborhood is it in\n",
      "622  :   \n",
      "623  :   The campus is located in the new space opened by WeWork. It is located in the 9th arrondissement  near the Paris Opera. It is accessible via 3 metro lines  8 bus lines  2 bike sharing stations  and 2 car sharing stations. It will be open 24 7 for our students.\n",
      "624  :   \n",
      "625  :   The place is absolutely magnificent  both in terms of design and community. Students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio  and meeting working rooms to complete their projects and assignments.\n",
      "626  :   \n",
      "627  :   What web development and UX UI design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why  Are the ones you ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in Paris\n",
      "628  :   \n",
      "629  :   The core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area. Then we tailor the mentors  the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem. So  for Web Development  we ll be focusing on full stack Javascript but we ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here  ex  React or Meteor  and industries that are the rising trends  ex  online media and entertainment .\n",
      "630  :   \n",
      "631  :   How many instructors and or mentors will you have in Paris\n",
      "632  :   \n",
      "633  :   We ll have a lead instructor  who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community. He has several years of experience in startups and IT services agencies. He ll be assisted by a TA  who is a bit more junior  but passionate about education and teaching students. Plus  we ll have a network of 15 20 mentors to help and coach students  for coding as well as for management. Mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students. Also  the students of the first Web Development session will be sponsored by Florian Jourda. Florian was the 1st engineer at Box and scaled their dev team from 2 to 300 people. He spent 8 years in the Silicon Valley and is now Chief Product Officer at Bayes Impact  an NGO funded by Google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment.\n",
      "634  :   \n",
      "635  :   How many students do you usually have in a cohort  How many can you accommodate\n",
      "636  :   \n",
      "637  :   For that first cohort  we plan to have 20 students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience. That will ensure a strong monitoring of students  as well as a perfect operational execution on our side. For the next cohorts  we ll increase the number of students  but we won t go above 30 and we ll recruit 1 or 2 more TAs to keep the same quality.\n",
      "638  :   \n",
      "639  :   What kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful\n",
      "640  :   \n",
      "641  :   Students often ask that question and it s always hard to answer. Everything depends on their learning curve. On average  students work between 50 to 70 hours a week  mainly on projects and assignments. But we re fully transparent on this   you can t learn real hard skills and get a job in 3 months without fully dedicating yourself. We make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won t see time passing by\n",
      "642  :   \n",
      "643  :   How is your campus similar or different to the other Ironhack campuses\n",
      "644  :   \n",
      "645  :   I think that our campus is pretty similar to Miami s. We are located in an amazing coworking space  in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around. The main difference would be our rooftop on the 8th floor of the building  where we regularly organize events and lunches.\n",
      "646  :   \n",
      "647  :   How are you approaching job placement in a new city  Does Ironhack have an employer network already\n",
      "648  :   \n",
      "649  :   Job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs. We have already partnered with  20 tech companies  such as Drivy  world leader in peer to peer car rental   Jumia  the equivalent of Amazon in Africa and Middle East   Stootie  Europe leader in peer to peer services   Kima Ventures  VC fund of Xavier Niel  with  400 portfolio companies   etc. Usually  they are large startups  from Series A to Series D  looking to hire web developers. As a GM  it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners.\n",
      "650  :   \n",
      "651  :   What types of companies are hiring developers in Paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from Ironhack s Paris campus\n",
      "652  :   \n",
      "653  :   I think there are 3 types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from Ironhack   corporations in Telecom Media Technology  startups  from Series A to series D  and IT services companies. The demand is really intense for the last two options  as they re looking for people mastering the latest technologies  in high volumes. Based on the enthusiasm they ve expressed when talking with Ironhack  we know they ll be great recruiting partners.\n",
      "654  :   \n",
      "655  :   What sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other Ironhack campuses and what do you expect for Ironhack Paris graduates  Do they usually stay in the city after graduation\n",
      "656  :   \n",
      "657  :   Based on the metrics of other campuses  usually  50 60  of people join a startup as an employee  a Junior Web Developer  Project Manager or Growth Hacker . 20 30  create their own startup after the course  while 20 30  become freelancers  usually in Web Development  and work on a remote basis. We ll have a good share of students who are not from France originally  so we think some of them might leave Paris after the course. But we ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we ll keep constant interaction with those students.\n",
      "658  :   \n",
      "659  :   What meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in Paris who wants to get started\n",
      "660  :   \n",
      "661  :   France has some great players in the field. If you want to get an intro to Javascript  I would recommend you visit OpenClassrooms  Codecademy or CodeCombat. Then  in terms of meetups  The Family and NUMA are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events. Some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they re usually apprehended at a beginner level.\n",
      "662  :   \n",
      "663  :   Any final thoughts that you d like our readers to know about Ironhack Paris\n",
      "664  :   \n",
      "665  :   We want to build something that is nothing like what exists in Paris. In 3 months  you ll be operational in Web Development  you ll meet awesome people  students  mentors  entrepreneurs  and you ll accomplish your professional project. Send us an email to know more at paris ironhack.com. We have a few seats left for the session starting on June 26th. Next session will start on September 4th.

      "673  :   Miami coding bootcamp Ironhack recently launched an intensive course in UX UI Design  where students learn everything they need to know about user research  rapid prototyping  user testing  and front end web development to land their first job in UX design. We sat down with instructor  and UX superstar  Jacqueline Pastore on their first day of class to find out what makes a great UX UI Designer  think  listening skills  empathy and communication   how the school produces User Experience Unicorns by incorporating HTML Bootstrap skills into the curriculum  and the teaching style that future students can expect at Ironhack Miami.\n",

      "676  :   \n",
      "677  :   How did you become a successful UX Designer  Did you get a degree in  UX Design\n",
      "678  :   \n",
      "679  :   I m a career changer  My background was first in film and creative writing  and I worked in the film industry in Miami before I ended up in Boston  temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on Harvard and MIT startups. I learned from really smart people about computers  software  graphic design  and project management  and IBM had their Lotus Notes usability labs next door  so I got to participate as a usability tester. I went back to grad school at Bentley University for my Masters in Human Factors in Information Design  and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at Microsoft  Staples  Adidas  and Reebok  and UX design for Fidelity Investments  Staples  the Federal Reserve  JP Morgan Chase  H amp R Block  Novartis Pharmaceuticals  and Zumba Fitness.\n",
      "680  :   \n",
      "681  :   Two years ago  I moved back to Miami and started my own product  UX Gofer  which is a UX research tool.\n",
      "682  :   \n",
      "683  :   After spending years learning User Experience and even getting a Masters degree  why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn UX Design\n",
      "684  :   \n",
      "685  :   I went through my grad program very quickly  in one year   so I believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job. That s exactly why I ve had a successful career  by specifically going after different verticals  technologies  and platforms. If I hadn t used something before  I wanted to try it. I believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career.\n",
      "686  :   \n",
      "687  :   What made you excited to work at Ironhack in particular  what stands out about Ironhack to you as a professional UX Designer\n",
      "688  :   \n",
      "689  :   It was the people. I was referred to Ironhack by someone I ve respected in the industry for years  and they were right. The people running Ironhack are what convinced me to work on this UX Bootcamp.\n",
      "690  :   \n",
      "691  :   Did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp  What is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp\n",
      "692  :   \n",
      "693  :   I teach now at the University of Miami  at conferences  and bootcamps. At Ironhack  my personal teaching style is to lecture very little  and focus on hands on work. It s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do  but at the end of the day  you have to deliver. So we spend the majority of our days doing activities  which means running surveys  doing interviews  running usability tests  designing products. I think it s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp  instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course. For someone breaking into the UX community  the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects.\n",
      "694  :   \n",
      "695  :   \n",
      "696  :   \n",
      "697  :   This is Ironhack s first foray into UX UI design courses  Tell us about the curriculum.\n",
      "698  :   \n",
      "699  :   Marcelo Paiva and I created the Ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field. We follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace.\n",
      "700  :   \n",
      "701  :   We start with user research   how to talk to your target market  the methodology behind that research  what to do with that data  deliverables  and turning that data into concept design.\n",
      "702  :   \n",
      "703  :   We move into information architecture and interaction design  with low fidelity all the way into high fidelity  and micro interaction models. We use Invision  Sketch  and Principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum. Then we move into visual design for mobile and web  because they are two different beasts.\n",
      "704  :   \n",
      "705  :   Then we move into front end development  where students learn how to implement the designs they re creating. This is what the industry is looking for right now  the unicorns that can do the HTML and bootstrap to implement their own designs. That will make Ironhack students really effective and marketable.\n",
      "706  :   \n",
      "707  :   Finally  we move into individual projects. Ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from Day One  but towards the end of the course  they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven t covered yet.\n",
      "708  :   \n",
      "709  :   I m so super excited about this bootcamp and I think it s really valuable.\n",
      "710  :   \n",
      "711  :   Is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend in the UX UI field right now\n",
      "712  :   \n",
      "713  :   It depends on where our graduates choose to work. As part of a smaller team  a UX Designer will have to be more of a generalist  and need to do research  design  and development. If they re working for a larger organization  they can specialize in a particular field within UX like ethnography  or mobile design  or design thinking. As a whole  I think careers in the UX community are becoming both broader and more specialized. The UX community is both coming together and breaking into niches.\n",
      "714  :   \n",
      "715  :   How many instructors  TAs  and or mentors do you have  Is there an ideal student teacher ratio\n",
      "716  :   \n",
      "717  :   The student teacher ratio for the UX UI course is 10 1. Many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of 3 or 4. As the principal instructor  I lead and teach the main flow of the course  and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized e.g. design thinking  front end development  etc.\n",
      "718  :   \n",
      "719  :   Can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for Ironhack s UX UI Design Bootcamp  What s your class like right now  And how do the UX students differ from the coding bootcamp students\n",
      "720  :   \n",
      "721  :   The ideal student for the UX UI Design Bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills  can use empathy to jump into other people s shoes  and has a passion for user experience. The current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds  for example  some profiles include a former Marketing Manager for Sony Music  a Research Director from the non profit space  and an MBA grad looking to use their previous Business Process skills to crack into the UX sector.\n",

      "725  :   This is a full time bootcamp  but how many hours a week do you expect your students to commit to Ironhack Miami\n",
      "726  :   \n",
      "727  :   In addition to the daily schedule of 9am to 6pm  we expect students to spend approximately 20 hours outside of class time to work on assignments and projects  so about  65 hours week.\n",
      "728  :   \n",
      "729  :   In a UX bootcamp  is the style largely project based  Can you give us an example\n",
      "730  :   \n",
      "731  :   Yes  students will work on 2 projects during the first 6 weeks  one individual project and one group project . These projects are a sum of the individual units we cover on a week by week basis. The capstone of the course is a 2 week final project that each student completes individually  as they go through the entire user and product development lifecycles. The result at the end of the course is that each student has 3 prototypes that they can use as portfolio pieces moving forward.\n",
      "732  :   \n",
      "733  :   What s the goal for a student that graduates from Ironhack  in terms of career and ability   For example  will they be prepared for a junior UX UI role  A senior role\n",
      "734  :   \n",
      "735  :   The goal of this course is to provide students the skills to carry out a UX UI design process from beginning to end in multiple circumstances with varying goals. As a result  students will be prepared for junior and entry level roles in UX UI fields  depending on which part of that process most interests them.\n",

So how do you decide what to budget for  Here  we break down the costs of coding bootcamps from around the USA. This is a cost comparison of full stack  front end and back end  in person  on site  immersive bootcamps that are nine weeks or longer  and many of them also include extra remote pre work study. We have chosen courses which we think are comparable in course content   they all teach HTML  CSS  and JavaScript  plus back end languages or frameworks such as Ruby on Rails  Python  Angular  and Node.js. All schools listed here have at least one campus in the USA.

      "760  :   \n",
      "761  :   The Ironhack application process falls into 3 stages  the written application  first interview  and second technical interview  and takes on average  10 15 days to complete in entirety.\n",

      "763  :   What goes into the written application  Does Ironhack require a video submission\n",
      "764  :   \n",

      "769  :   We are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that Ironhack attracts. We ve had former flight attendants  world travelling yoginis  and CS grads from Ivy Leagues all attend Ironhack. We ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people  regardless of educational background or pedigree. Those who tend to perform the best at Ironhack are those who have committed to doing so  not necessarily those with a technical background.\n",

      "785  :   When an applicant is in the midst of our process  we actually send them materials specifically to prepare for the technical interview and set office hours with our Teaching Assistants  so they can get some one on one time to address specific questions. Apart from that  If they already have some experience programming  https   autotelicum.github.io Smooth CoffeeScript literate js intro.html.

      "788  :   \n",
      "789  :   Ironhack s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools. The advantage of this is  it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time  and how dedicated they are to their goals. If they can t even complete the interview process  it s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through 8 weeks of a coding bootcamp  We look for curiosity  passion  and drive. Drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at Ironhack.\n",

I did a Master s degree of 400 hours in CICE  a IT school in Madrid  with the great luck to have an amazing teacher called Devta Singh. I learned much more than just coding from him.

This project was developed in two weeks and in order to achieve all the features that I wanted to include on it  I used Rails. As I wanted to demonstrate all the things that I had learned in IronHack  I decided to include Responsive Web Design  using CSS3  and JavaScript  jQuery and HTML5 functionalities like geolocalization or web storage to improve the user experience.\n",

      "1031  :   \n",
      "1032  :   I come from a finance background  I m originally from Puerto Rico  but spent 5 years in New York. My cofounder Gonzalo comes from the construction industry  he s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in Europe. Having said that  I come from a household of educators. Both of my parents were teachers when I was growing up and my father actually started a private university in Puerto Rico 20 years ago that started with 15 students and now they have 6 campuses and over 10 000 students enrolled.\n",
      "1033  :   \n",
      "1034  :   I think education was always a part of my DNA and I wanted to do something after completing my education. I met Gonzalo during our MBA  we were both at Wharton. He also wanted to do something in education in Europe and possibly in ed tech as well. During those 2 years of the MBA we were iterating ideas  constantly and I think had the same issue that most non technical founders have in the U.S.  which is having brilliant  ideas  but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an MVP  you re not able to do it. It s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development.\n",
      "1035  :   \n",
      "1036  :   Gonzalo and I took a 2 day course at Wharton where they taught us to do very basic Rails. Even though we didn t acquire the skills necessary to build our MVP  we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and non technical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period. After that experience  we started looking at the boot camp model. At that point  the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction. We thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad. I d done a lot of business in Latin America so I had some ties to the region. Gonzalo  my partner is Spanish  so our first bet was Spain.\n",

      "1041  :   \n",
      "1042  :   We ve had both profiles. We ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background. We ve been hesitant so far to say  go from total newbie to professional web developer in X weeks.  Our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code. Developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level  or people that are very smart  analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people.\n",

      "1055  :   \n",
      "1056  :   The other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don t have disparate levels prior to arriving  people just learn differently  at different velocities with different learning styles. So within the structure of 8 weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace  while ensuring that everyone s learning fundamentals.\n",

It s a country that has a lot to offer from the lifestyle perspective  you know  you have great food  the parties  study abroad in Spain has been an integral part of Spanish society for many years  within the traditional higher education arena. In our case  we re trying to position Spain in a similar fashion. In the first cohorts we trained a lot of people from Spain  but going forward we want to make it attractive for foreigners to come over and enjoy everything that Spain has to offer and at the same time  learn how to code.\n",
      "1075  :   \n",
      "1076  :   Barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there. Obviously within the EU there s a lot of mobility  if you re a European Union citizen  you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements. And I think a lot of northern Europeans and people from Germany for instance  love Barcelona for weather reasons  the great beaches  the lifestyle  so a lot of them are coming over to Barcelona to launch their own ventures here. In Barcelona  the tech ecosystem is thriving and it s very international. There s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there.\n",
      "1077  :   \n",
      "1078  :   Madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space. It s obviously an emerging ecosystem  nowhere near Silicon Valley  but we re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in Madrid  which is ultimately a driver for our type of business. Companies need funding to employ engineers and we re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects.\n",

We cover HTML  CSS and JavaScript on the front end  and then on the back we work with Ruby on Rails and teach a little bit of Sinatra as well. The first 6 weeks we re teaching those core technologies. And the last 2 weeks  students are working on their own project from scratch. The culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community  developers  startup cofounders  that type of audience.\n",
      "1105  :   \n",
      "1106  :   I d say 90  of our content is practical. We re big believers in the flipped classroom model  so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible. We get them all the resources  videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here. While they re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time.\n",
      "1107  :   \n",
      "1108  :   The technology demands in Spain are very fragmented. It s not like San Francisco where you can produce a gazillion Ruby on Rails grads every year and they ll be hired by Rails startups. Here  we re seeing some demand for Rails startups   but also Python  PHP  etc.\n",

      "1114  :   A hundred percent  and we re seeing that. Even though love the technologies we work with  we re not obsessed with them either. To us they re an instrument to teach good development practices. I think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices. We re obsessed with testing  clean code and good design patterns. We ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly  take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use.\n",

      "1152  :   We have a 3 step application process. The first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two 30 minute Skype interviews. The first 30 minute Skype interview is to get a sense of who you are  why you want to do this  and get a sense of is you fit within our culture  and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the 400 hours that you have here.\n",

      "1154  :   We say  Listen  you re going to be coding Monday through Friday  10 hours a day and then you re going to have work every day on Saturday Sunday   When I tell them that  we want someone who beams energy and positivity. If they make it through that interview  we have a second round  which is basically to assess technical skills. We ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before  but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp.\n",
      "1155  :   \n",
      "1156  :   In some cases  we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives  have never even worked with HTML.
